# Cross-compiling template

This project is a template for quickly setting up a CMake+Docker-based cross-compiling environment for all the target systems supported by [Dockcross](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross).

Dockcross is a powerful set of tools that greatly simplifies the task of cross-compiling for embedded (many) devices. If your project needs many external libraries, though, you still have to cross-compile those libraries, since Dockcross images come with the bare minimum for C/C++ compiling (i.e. the standard libraries).

This template aims at helping to **overcome this problem**.

The approach here is to cross-compile the dependencies within the docker image via proper Dockerfiles, so that you can build **tailored Dockcross images** that also contain your **cross-compiled dependencies**.

Furthermore, this template also provides a **basic backbone for a multiplatform project** plus three example Dockerfiles (for mipsel, ARMv7 and ARMv7a) that provide ncurses, readline, openssl, mosquitto, and lua5.3 libraries.

The project is based on CMake and has template targets for building static and shared libraries plus an executable. It also **uses Git tags for managing number versioning in-code**.

## Tested platforms
At the moment the template contains the following tested dockerfiles:
* `mipsel`: tested on Onion Omega2
* `armv6`: tested on Raspberry Pi
* `armv7`: tested on Variscite armv7 SOM
* `armv7a`: tested on BeagleBone Black

The following sections assume to cross-compile for the armv7 platform. For other platforms, just replace the `./armv7` command with your need.

## Typical workflow
Once the Docker containers are properly set up (see later), the typical workflow is the following:
```bash
# mount the remote system target install directory:
$ sshfs user@targethost.local:/workdir products
# configure for local and cross compiling:
$ cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
$ ./armv7 cmake -Bxbuild -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
# edit your source and compile/test it locally,
# (built products go in products_host dir):
$ make install
# build and install for target system
# (built products go in products dir):
$ ./armv7 make install
# open an ssh shell to the target system and test your executable
# (you will find it in /workdir/bin/)
# Correct bugs and repeat the last step until you are satisfied.
# Version your code and update version info:
$ git commit -am "commit message"
$ git tag -am "version comment" 0.1.0
$ ./armv7 cmake -Bxbuild -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ ./armv7 make package
# (optional) copy the installer to /workdir on the target system
$ cp xbuild/myproject-Release-0.1.0-0-g0c05e15-Linux.sh products/
```

# Instructions

## Step 1: Customize and build your Dockcross image
Take as example the `armv7.Dockerfile`: there are several steps showing how different libraries are cross compiled within the image. If the provided libraries are not enough, just add your own. My suggestion is to start with the provided image, build it with
```bash
$ docker build -t armv7 -f arm7.Dockerfile .
$ docker run --rm armv7 > armv7 && chmod a+x armv7
```
then open a shell with `./armv7 bash`. Within this shell try to download, configure and cross compile the library you need, following the library instructiond on cross-compiling (this often needs to pass some options to the `configure` script or to the cmake command).
Once you figured out how to cross-compile the library you need, just add an additional `RUN` section at the end of the dockerfile.

When you are done, **remember to uncomment the latter lines** in the original dockerfile, removing unnecessary intermidiate build directories to save disk space in the resulting docker image.

From now on, you can prepend the `./armv7` command to build instructions.

## Step2: Configure your project
For configuring the project, the usual CMake command must be prepended with the magic `./armv7` (or whichever is the name of your cross-build image) command:
```bash
# from within your project root directory
$ ./armv7 cmake -Bxbuild -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
while if you want to configure for your current (host) platform:
```bash
$ cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the Dockecross images mount the current working directory within the container, so that in order to access files in your project root you *must* invoke cmake from the project root. If you are tempred to do `cd xbuild; ./armv7 cmake ..` you will loose access to the project root and something probably will not work.

## Step 3: Build the project
For building, use the make command:
```bash
# from within your project root directory
$ ./armv7 make -Cxbuild
```
while if you want to build for your current (host) platform:
```bash
$ make -Cbuild
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: as per the note above, please invoke `./armv7 make` from the project root using the `-C` flag.

## Step 4: Installing the built binaries
You can now copy the binaries to the target platform according to your preferred procedure. I am here suggesting the one I find more effective and quick, though.

You have to set-up your target system by installing the `sshfs` package. This service allows you to mount a folder in the remote (target) system onto a folder of your development machine:
```bash
# from within your project root directory
$ sshfs user@target.ip:/path/to/prefix ./products
```

This command mounts the prefix directory on the target system onto the `products` subdir of your project directory. Since the Dockerfile install target is configured to install binaries into `products`, if you do
```bash
$ ./armv7 make -Cxbuild install
```
this installs the built stuff into `products/bin`, `products/lib`, `products/include`. In turn, since `products` mounts the prefix dir of the target system, the command `./armv7 make -Cxbuild install` compiles **and** copies the build results into the destination system in one single line. If you set `/usr/local` as prefix dir, your compiled stuff will end in `/usr/local/bin` etc.

**NOTE**: As an added value of this approach, within your editor you will have the possibility to remotely open and edit directly all the files in the mounted directory. This comes very handy for changing ASCII files that are part of the project, e.g. configuration files, data files, etc.

## Step 5: Create the installer
Using CPack, the provided Cmake template can easily create an installer for the linux environment:
```bash
$ ./armv7 make -Cxbuild package
```
The resulting instaler is in the `xbuild` folder, with a name with this scheme: `xtemplate-Release-0.0.1-1-g0c05e15-Linux.sh`, which reads like this: `<name>-<build type>-<version>-<patch>-<git hash>-<platform>.sh`. The patch number is the number of commits past the given version tag. 

If the git hash is followed by `ยง` then the originating git is in a dirty state, i.e., there are pending changes to be committed.

**NOTE**: the proper versioning information is collected by the cmake command, **not** by make. Consequently, in order to have updated and correct version numbering in the installer name and in the `defines.h` **remember to re-run cmake** before calling `make package`

# Visual Studio Code integration
This template also provides 4 *tasks* for Visual Studio Code. If you enter `tasks` in the command palette you will find:
1. `clean xbuild`: removes the content of the `xbuild` folder
2. `cross-configure`: performs the cmake configuration
3. `cross-compile`: performs the actual compilation
4. `install`: install the compilation results into `products`

On Mac, tasks can be quickly invoked with `cmd-shift-B`, on Linux/Windows with `ctrl-shift-B`.
You can customize the tasks by editing the `.vscode/tasks.json` file.
